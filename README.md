Short Interactive Fiction

I wrote this back in 2008. It's the only piece of interactive fiction I've ever written. It's not very good, but it has the saving grace of being quite short.
There's really only one puzzle and it's not that hard; maybe 5 minutes if you've ever played IF before. It was mostly a vehicle for trying out the natural language programming model of Inform 7; the story was written for a friend whom I did Judo with, and who also had an interest in playing IF. But you'll see this...

Recently I've been working on niz, my own Z-machine interpreter, and just got a first cut of .z5 support working, when I remembered this IF written nearly a decade earlier & dug it out from an email attachment. There's both the .z5 story file, and the original Inform 7 source. To avoid spoiling the puzzle, hold off on reading the source until you've at least tried the game. But the source is worth looking at to see what NL programming looks like. Lovely to read!

Unfortunately, this is the first Inform compiled game I've tried to put through niz, and it reveals a couple of unimplemented .z5 opcodes (save_undo), so you wont get far using niz until I've sorted this.

Happily, I found a nice Android App called "Text Fiction" which allows you to play this game (and any other I assume) on your phone. It has a cool text-chat style interface which takes away much of the pain of typing by supporting common verbs & touching words from the displayed text.

Have fun.
